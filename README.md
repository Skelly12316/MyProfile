<p>s3987667, S3987667@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
<p>My nationality is Australian, as is my whole family. I have lived in Bundaberg, Queensland for my whole 21 years of life. My highest level of education is currently Year 12, but I am currently enrolled in both IIT and Programming with RMIT University. My primary hobby when I am not working retail full time is gaming on my new PC which I built on my own with no experience or help apart from YouTube videos. Otherwise, I am spending time with my partner and our cat, rats, and fish.
IT became a larger part in my life when I realized that my line of work just did not make me happy anymore, friends from my workplace both enrolled with RMIT doing the same courses and informed me of my possibilities within IT. With that came the urge to build my own PC and enroll shortly after, even with little to no experience, I still want to do the best I can. RMIT was my chosen University as at the time of my enrolment, there was government aid which gave me the final push to commit to these courses. My expectations are extremely high in learning the inner-workings of IT and increasing my knowledge within the fields of web-development, App-development, both front and back end, alongside understanding more about designing and programming for businesses.</p>

<p>	 Extraversion 40%<p>
<p>	 Agreeableness 69%<p>
<p>	 Neuroticism 67%<p>

<p>These test results further prove my own thoughts that I tend to be an introverted and rather emotional person that does tend to bottle up any negative feelings. During any teamwork in which I’m involved, I may tend to sit back and stay quiet to keep the peace rather than speak my mind. When forming a team, my main priority will be focusing on speaking up to any concerns or issues which I may run into during group work.<p>

<h1 style="color:purple;">Project Idea</h1>
<p>My chosen project type is a mobile application that creates an algorithm based off the user’s input of previously consumed foods alongside the user’s chosen preferred meal types that can be selected at any given time. This will make choosing what to eat for any meal of the day much easier for the user and take away the stress of being indecisive when they can’t quite choose what to eat. The app will be very simple and easy to navigate as the main goal is to get the user sorted and on track as soon as possible by using a streamlined service with minimal navigation.<p>

<p>There’s been countless times where I find myself lost thinking about what to have for dinner, so the idea for this app comes with a passion to save time stressing and more time enjoying a delicious meal. Supercook is a recipe search engine that lets users search by ingredients and find thousands of recipes with this information while bringing in almost 200,000 users per month. This information gives me solid faith in knowing that my program will be successful. My own personal motivation is by creating a working algorithm would be my ideal goal as well as to grow my skillset and knowledge while also opening the door to many more interesting projects.<p>

<p>At first glance, my mobile app begins the user experience by giving a large choice of randomized meals in which the user can like, or dislike for as long as they feel necessary. Cycling imagery of food types of form breakfast lunch and dinner appear on the main page, when these images are pressed, the app will take the user to the selection page. On this page, the user can decide what type of meal they’re looking for depending on the time of day, the application will then provide the user with a short list of food options with the first 3 being recommended. After the user has finished any meal, (whether the app recommended it or not), they will then select an option from the drop-down menu in which all previously consumed food choices are stored. Every time a food or meal is placed into this section, the stronger the algorithm will become, basing food recommendations based on; Food culture, dish type, primary flavors, spice levels, etc. This drop-down menu will also contain take-out options that are nearby the user by accessing their location and this will also supply recommended meal types but from various fast-food locations, restaurants and local business. When accessing the takeout options, the user will also have the choice of delivery by using sites such as Menulog, Uber eats and Businesses own delivery methods to make our user experience easier. As for the design of the mobile app, the main page will feature a light-grey background, textured with small shapes to give off an immersive feeling while also being easy on the eyes and not too distracting. The drop-down menu will be a burger design, (Three basic white lines) and will be located at the top left of the screen, this is used as it’s seen as a universal menu type used by countless sites and applications. Scrolling down the page will also show more imagery with titles relating to the same sections contained within the drop-down menu. Pressing any of these images will then take you to the related sections. Another section within the drop-down menu will be “Contact Us”, where the user can then access the contact email address to bring forward any complaints or queries that they may have in relation to the application. The main centerpiece will be the alternating images of different food types located in the dead-center of the user’s screen and will be specifically chosen based on colour and looks to help attract users to different varieties of food. Above this will be the name of my application which is still unknown as of this point, however, some options include; “Choose-it”, “Feed-Me” and “Food4You”. The application name will be shown in a bright, bold red to help compliment the textured, grey background. All licensing and copyright material will be contained at the very bottom of the application under very fine print to not distract from the whole experience from the application while also providing all relevant legalities required for the application. <p>
 
 <p>Programming skills are required for creating mobile applications, specifically app languages like JavaScript, C++ and C#. Backend computing will be required for app development, this includes understanding Framework, database management, hardware interaction and security. Business management is also a skill that can be required for my application as it is customer based and will require constant attention to any customer complaints. Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine can be used to create an algorithm for the application. This is one of the best choices as it’s easy to navigate and openly available for use with all relevant information and directions for use readily available. <p>
 
 <p>As previously mentioned, Programming skills and languages are required to be learnt in order to successfully create a functioning mobile application, other skills required include; Product management, Internet of things, agile development, cross-platform development, User interface design, Cybersecurity and communication. As for hardware, the lowest processor required for app development is an Intel Core i5 but anything higher is highly recommended. At least 8GB of RAM is required for IOS development but 16GB is recommended. At least 256GB storage is required, however, 512GB is highly recommended. It is also highly recommended that instead of using external HD storage, to use SSD instead. <p>

<p>If this mobile app does render to be a success, it will greatly benefit the average user’s day by cutting out the stress and headaches associated with decision making when time is incredibly important, especially in a customer-based setting. This project will also help to give myself the experience and initial push to open the doorway into my ideal career choice in relation to the business aspect of application development. Other career paths may even stem from the success of my mobile app which will help to shape my career within the IT field depending on change of interests or newfound passions. <p>
